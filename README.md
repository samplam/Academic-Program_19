# Academic-Program_19
My nineteenth evaluated program for an academic course. A program to display the global earthquakes.

## Overview
This program was coded for an evaluation and I had to make use of async programming. The subjet was up to the student. It's a program that retrieves information on global earthquakes from a website. On startup, it loads the data from a local file if one exists. Then, it retrieves the data from the website and creates a JSON file if one is not available. With each update, whether manual or automatic, the data is saved to the JSON file. The data is updated hourly from the website, but a manual update button is also available on the webpage. The data is presented in a table where certain columns can be sorted. It is also possible to perform a basic search within the table to filter the results.

## Features
- Python coding with loops and logic
- Commented and structured code for readability
- Async file reading

## Skills Highlighted
- Custom dependency managing
- Programming in Python
- Progamming logic and functions
- Async programming
- Use of functions
- Use of FP
- Use of exceptions

## Usage
1. Open 'tn3.py' in Python
2. Use the interface to display the required informations about earthquakes

## Notes
- Coded in 2025 during my Bachelor's degree
- For this project, the use of AI was not only permitted, but encouraged. ChatGPT was used to help coding this program.
